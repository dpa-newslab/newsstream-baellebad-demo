# "out of order" notice

The application will display the contents of the HTML file outoforder.html in a modal window on startup. This can be used to tell viewers that the 
app is not displaying correct data currently. 

A outoforder.html.example file is excluded. By renaming it to "outoforder.html" it can be activated.
